	   <p>  I am a Junior majoring in Information Science with a 
		certificate in Computer Science. I love computers and 
		technology, and I am interested in how technology shapes 	
		us as a society. I am hoping to better understand biases in 
		technology and how we can mitigate them properly. </p>

	   <p>I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and Math. 
	      I have previously done research on mitigating bias in AI 
	      and LLMs, including the topic of intersectionality in fairness 
	      algorithms. My goal is to understand what causes biases in these 
	      systems and work toward making them fairer and more equitable.</p>

           <p>I am a senior majoring in Information Science. I have
		always had a strong interest in both technology and sociology
		so I am looking forward
		to further explore the ways in which technology intersects
		with bias, and learning how to prevent it from affecting 
		the future of technology and society.
